# TeclastF6ProTabletMode
Script to switch to tablet mode in linux based on KIONIX Accelerometers in base and display which does not work due identity matrix used as fallback despite correct matrix being defined in 60-sensor.hwdb.
Moreover, for KIONIX accelerometers in base and display, `SW_TABLET_MODE` is explicitly disabled as can be seen in [Linux Kernel dual_accel_detect.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/7503345ac5f5e82fd9a36d6e6b447c016376403a/drivers/platform/x86/dual_accel_detect.h#L9)

# TODO
## Functionality
### Linear algebra
- Angle between two vectors needs to be between-180 and +180째, standard method is always between 0 and 180째. This way one cannot destinguish between degrees above and below 180, like 90 and 270.
- [Maths](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1904152/how-to-find-an-angle-in-range-180-180-between-2-vectors)

## Tablet mode activation SW_TABLET_MODE
- Tablet mode activation not working, but it was working in previous version. Copy over state


## Performance
### X-Axis
- X-axis can be disregarded since it is same between base and display, only read Y and Z data

## Robustness
- Angle Activation Hysteresis (enable at $-\alpha째$, disable at +5째)
Time hysteresis (if enable conditions are met: test again n times)
Sleep (if enable conditions are not met: sleep for n secs)
Low Pass Filter (if needed) on accel values


## Modularity
// TODO: Retrieve from device config in 60-sensor.hwdb or udev rules instead of hardcoding
[libudev](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/libudev.html)
get_mount_matrix_udev.c work in progress, but it does not show the same mount matrix as udevadm info -n  /dev/iio:device0
